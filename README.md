#1 Safe Box: An example of how to use DM and Zaps to interact with IoT devices
First example: A Multi-DM Safe Box

A Lilygo T-Display S3 will serve as our Safe Box for this time-limited competition; hence, it should be waiting for the previously hard-coded pubkeys to send it a DM;
It should become orange on the display when one of the DM is identified, suggesting that another pubkey needs to DM as well; It should flash green as soon as the other pubkey DM arrives, indicating that the conditions are met; it could then send a signal to the safe box itself to open the door; And for now, that's it;

To-Do:
* Sure, tidy the code;
* Add support to NIP-5, Zaps, and passphrase at the DM;
* Implement other use cases and share at the Github;
* Clean the code, always;
* Implement time lock;
* Implement pubkey validation with Zaps
* Build other examples;

* Special shoutout to LNbits and MakerBits communities, Ben Arc, BlackCoffe and Calle for the amazing work and collaboration, also Abdre Neves for the mentoring!

* Project build and presented at SatsHack SÃ£o Paulo - 03 november 2023 -  Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dhbu2fdxXNxrFq2Rap_0n3heBFkCwFHG/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103025837986292071011&rtpof=true&sd=true
